  <h2>Description</h2>

<p>My mother is one of the best cooks I know. She makes stews where we mostly find dumplings in them. We never eat things from packages or microwaves and you sure could taste what food was.
  That's the only way I cook today - I don't use any electronic gadgets to cook with except an electric stove.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt/li>
<li>1 tablespoon margarine</li>
<li>½ cup milk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps to cook:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in medium size bowl. Cut in butter until crumbly. Stir in milk to make a soft dough.</li>
<li>Drop by spoonfuls into boiling stew. Cover and simmer 15 minutes without lifting lid. Serve.</li>
<li>To make parsley dumplings, add 1 tablespoon parsley flakes to the dry ingredients.</li>
</ol>
